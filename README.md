# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes such as phones, tablets, and computer screens. This is accomplished using grid and flex properties. 

**Technologies and Techniques used**

This project has used Figma for the template, HTMl and CSS to create and stylize the webpage, along with Github and Gitbash to track changes and keep different versions of the project. The most notable technqiues used in this project were grid and flex properties to ensure the correct alignment of the cards and the profile content on different screens. 
  
**Figma**  
  The figma design gave the template on how the webpage should look like and function for mobile devices and computer monitors. I started off by creating the page for 1280p resolution and worked my way down to mobile resolutions (320p).
