### Overview  

* Intro

* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes such as phones, tablets, and computer screens. It is centered around having around a traveler having a page about themselves and the places they have been to. 
  
**Figma**  
  The figma design gave the template on how the webpage should look like and function for mobile devices and computer monitors. I started off by creating the page for 1280p resolution and worked my way down to mobile resolutions (320p).
